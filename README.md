## Description
The model predicts the prices of properties in Belgium, based on data that were gathered in a previous scraping project.
In relation with the postal code, the state of the construction, the property subtype (apartment, studio, villa, chalet, ...),
and existance of a fireplace, terrace, garden and/or fully equiped kitchen, an estimate of the asking price is made.

The accuracy of the model is 0.89, which means that there is always a possibility for outliers (less then 11 %). More importantly: in 89 %
of the cases the prediction will be within a respectable range.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```
https://github.com/jejobueno/Signature-Recognition-BD.git
``` 
 
Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## Usage
  

To train the model you could use the following command:
```
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 300 --data custom_dataset.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --cache
```   

## Output
When you run the program, you will get:
