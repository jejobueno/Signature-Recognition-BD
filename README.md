## Description
YOLOv5 model training to detect signatures on documents, it was trained with annotated documents transformed to jpg and addapting their annotations from an .xml format to a .txt normalizing and transpolating the coordinates to the yolo format. 

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```
https://github.com/jejobueno/Signature-Recognition-BD.git
``` 
 
Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## Usage
  

To train the model you could use the following command:
```
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 300 --data custom_dataset.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --cache
```   

To detect signatures from a determinated folder user the following command:
```
python detect.py --weights ./runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --conf 0.60 --source ./data/test
```   

This command will read all files from the folder path `/data/test` and mark all the detected signatures with their confidence score inside the `runs/detect/exp/` folder. If you don't want them just add the argument `--nosave`

## Output
When you run the program, you will get a csv with the boundry boxes coordinates and confidences called `bboxes.csv`, also another csv file marking if the images contains any signature or not calles `results_yolo.csv`

If you runned the command wwithour the argument `--nosave` you'll find also insde the folder `runs\detect\exp\` the images with the signatures detected as following image

This model works with a 94,4382% of accuracy detecting signatures on test set provided by the client.
